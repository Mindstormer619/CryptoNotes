    "The whole point, as given in the first line, is that the ciphertext must tell _nothing_ about the plaintext. Thus, as the key is what hinges together the whole cryptosystem, it is imperative for the key to not be biased in distribution. Moreover, if the attacker gets his hands on a ciphertext, they must not be able to tell if the message is some $m_1$, or some $m2$, or anything else really. In other words, for all pairs $m_0$ and $m_1$ in the message space, the attacker will not be able to _distinguish_ from the ciphertext if the original message is one or the other, simply because the probability of any of those messages being the original is exactly the same.\n",
