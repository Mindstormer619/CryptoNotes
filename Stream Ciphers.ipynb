    "The whole point, as given in the first line, is that the ciphertext must tell _nothing_ about the plaintext. Thus, as the key is what hinges together the whole cryptosystem, it is imperative for the key to not be biased in distribution. Moreover, if the attacker gets his hands on a ciphertext, they must not be able to tell if the message is some $m_1$, or some $m2$, or anything else really. In other words, for all pairs $m_0$ and $m_1$ in the message space, the attacker will not be able to _distinguish_ from the ciphertext if the original message is one or the other, simply because the probability of any of those messages being the original is exactly the same.\n",

    "A OTP has perfect secrecy. Intuitively, we can understand this easily enough. Consider that the XOR operation is basically a bit-flip or a no-bit-flip. If the second input to the XOR is 0, it retains the first input. If the input is 1, it flips the first input.\n",

    "Thus, a randomly generated one-time key (uniformly distributed over the keyspace) will either flip or not flip each bit in the message string with an equal probability. In other words, given say a bit 1 in the ciphertext, we have no idea if the message originally contained a flipped bit (0) or a non-flipped bit (1). This makes the message perfectly unintelligible to the attacker who has no knowledge of the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Turns out, Shannon proved that if you need perfect secrecy, the number of keys in the keyspace must be greater than or equal to the number of possible messages. In other words, $\\left | \\mathcal{K} \\right | \\geq \\left | \\mathcal{M} \\right |$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want all possible messages of length $n$ bits, then naturally according to the above, the length of the _keys_ themselves must be equal to or more than the length of the messages.\n",

If these bits are enough to predict the next $r$ bits of the PRNG, then he can simply XOR those predicted bits with the ciphertext to recover more bits of the message.\n",
